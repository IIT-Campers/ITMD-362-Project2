          <p>Perhaps the biggest draw to Ten-X Campground in northern Arizona is its proximity to the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. Located just 4 miles south of the park entrance in beautiful Kaibab National Forest, Ten-X is a quiet, peaceful campground that generally has open camping sites.
             A nature trail weaves its way through the pine forest, and many more hiking opportunities are within a short drive. The facility can accommodate individual and family visitors, as well as large groups up to 75 people.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Natural Features: Ten-X is situated in a pleasant Ponderosa pine and Gambel oak forest at an elevation of 6,600 ft. The forest is nestled on the Colorado Plateau, an area of land that was uplifted by geologic processes. </li>
            <li>Recreation: The campground has a short nature hike that allows visitors to view local flora and fauna. Elsewhere, the nearby town of Tusayan offers horseback riding, helicopter rides and other tours. </li>
            <li>Facilities: The facility is attractive, well-maintained and spacious. There are 70 single-unit campsites organized in a large loop, each accommodating up to eight people.
                Single-family sites 1-13, 22-30 and 45-70 are non-reservable and only available on a first-come, first-served basis. Sites are comfortable with bathrooms, water and paved parking nearby. Sites 2, 3 and 4 have tent pads. </li>
            <li>Nearby Attractions: Grand Canyon National Park's South Rim, just 4 miles away, is a must-see for Ten-X campers. </li>
