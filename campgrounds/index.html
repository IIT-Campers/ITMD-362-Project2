            Perhaps the biggest draw to Ten-X Campground in northern Arizona is
            its proximity to the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park.
            Located just 4 miles south of the park entrance in beautiful Kaibab
            National Forest, Ten-X is a quiet, peaceful campground that
            generally has open camping sites. A nature trail weaves its way
            through the pine forest, and many more hiking opportunities are
            within a short drive. The facility can accommodate individual and
            family visitors, as well as large groups up to 75 people.

              Natural Features: Ten-X is situated in a pleasant Ponderosa pine
              and Gambel oak forest at an elevation of 6,600 ft. The forest is
              nestled on the Colorado Plateau, an area of land that was uplifted
              by geologic processes.

              Recreation: The campground has a short nature hike that allows

            Tucked away high atop the Cerro Noroeste, you'll find solitude,
            serenity and unsurpassed scenery as you lose yourself in a pleasant
            grove of Jeffrey pines at Campo Alto Campground. Campsites are
            spacious, the air is filled with a pine-sweet scent, and you will
            enjoy end-of-the-road privacy. Invigorated by the fresh air, your
            inner hiker will hunger to head out on the Vincent Tumameit
            Trailhead to enjoy the scenic mountain vistas. Do your best to leave
            this natural setting just as you found it. The campsites have no
            barriers to block your view, so most modest sized RVs, and all tent
            campers fit well here.
